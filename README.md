# data-analytics
It contains data analytics work in python.

File  cars.py

    Reference: CAR data with 50 observations

    a) Carefully observe the data. Apparently what it seems?
    
    b) It is proposed to analyse the data with the calculations of AM (Arithmetic Mean), GM
    (Geometric Mean) and HM (Harmonic Mean). Calculate such mean measures. Which
    mean calculation has a real significance to the data? Justify your answers.
    
    c) Do you suggest any other measurement(s) which might be useful implications? 

File earthQ.py 
    
    Reference: EARTHQUAKE data with 8086 observations
    
    a) The table includes the severity of earthquakes at different places in India during the
    year 2016. You are advised to browse the data carefully. Point out the
    discrepancy(ies), if any.
    
    b) For the given data, calculate the “Five point summary” and hence draw the box plot.
    
    c) Use the ITR calculation and then decide nay data as outlier(s). Remove the outlier(s),
    if found. Taking the cleaned data, obtain the box plot? Compare the two box plots. 

FILE automobiles.py

    Reference: AUTOMOBILE data with 205 observations
    
    a) Categorize all the attributes listed in the table according to the NOIR topology?
    
    b) Apply the applicable central tendency measures to any four attributes taking one
    attribute from each category.
    
    c) Consider the attribute “peak-rpm” and “city-mpg”? Find which probability
    distribution(s) they are likely to follow?

FILE iris.py
    
    Reference: IRISH data with 50 observations
    
    a) Consider the 150 observations as very close to population data. Find the population
    mean.
    
    b) Assume a sample of size 50 chosen at random, find the population variance.
    
    c) Compare the sample variance with that of population variance?
    
    
    
    
FILE weather.py
    
    Reference: WEATHER data during 1901-2002
    
    a) The data pertaining to weather from National Data Centres across the major cities in
    India. The data are in PDF form, which can be easily converted to CSV (Comma
    Separate Value) format or XLS (Excel Worksheet) format according to your
    requirement.
    
    b) Store the data using data cube model.
    
    c) Apply the operation(s) (e.g., slice, dice, roll up drill down) to extract a particular data
    (e.g., the data about North-East region) from the data cube you have obtained.
